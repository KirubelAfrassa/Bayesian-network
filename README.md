# Bayesian-network Mat Lab implementation of system models using BNT. Inference, Parameter learning and reliability analysis. 
Firstly, HailFinder2.5 is a Bayesian network (56 nodes and 66 edges) that is design for hail forcasting system. Here analyzed is Kevin Murphy's Bayes tool box inference algorithms' as well as parameter learning algorithms' accuracy and efficiency.

Secondly a similar implementation is done on illgraen Decision Graph, which is an Early warning system,
for the purpose of reliability analysis of the components represented as Bayesian network nodes.
