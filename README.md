# Bayesian-network Mat Lab implementation of two different models. 
Firstly, HailFinder2.5 is a Bayesian network that is design for hail forcasting system. Here analyzed is Kevin Murphy's Bayes tool box
inference algorithms' as well as parameter learning algorithms' accuracy and efficiency.

Secondly a similar implementation is done on illgraen Deecision Graph, which is an Early warning system,
for the purpose of reliabily analysis of the components represented as Bayesian network nodes.
